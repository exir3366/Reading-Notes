# Git Intro

- This topic that the reading passages are about Git/Git Hub and the terminal integrations that Git offers is very important because as developers we are going to be using Git/Git Hub throughout our careers. Addtionally, we will be using Git Hub on our respective computers (whether thats PC or Mac)

- I felt like this article was so dense and there was a lot to unpack but not to much. For example, there was a lot of information about the integrations with Git Hub and the Mac terminal.

- ## To illustrate, Git is integrated by offering terminal line comnmands that can-

1. **Clone** repositories locally to your system

2. commands that allow you to push all of your session changes back up to Git Hub with the **Git Commit** command

3. Is fully integrated with **VS Code**and allows you to load a repository from your system straight into a VS Code environment
