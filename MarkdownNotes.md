# *** Growth Mindset Reading *** 

  What the growth mindset means to me is that its a state of mind where an individual will use moments in their lives of adversity to better themselves and their lives. Someone whn employs the ** growth mindset ** is going to take a look at the long term aznd see how zny short term frustrztions will and can be used to better themselves and their abilities. Moreover, an individual who is in the growth mindeset is taking or trying to take all adversse situations and grow from them. 
  
# * Three Reminders to Keep Myself in the Growth Mindset *
1. One of the first things that I try and do is remember that when faced with frustration and adversity I can make it through to the other side
2. Next, I can think about the skills that I have to be able to solve the issue or problem in front of me
3. Another way to keep in the growth mindset is to be as proactive as possible.
