 ## Anatomy of an HTML element

__ Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.

**paragraph element** including opening tag, content reading 'my cat is very grumpy', and a closing tag

### The main parts of our element are as follows:

**The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

**The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

**The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

**The element:** The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
