# MDN Control Flow

- The control flow is the order in which the computer will execute statements in a script 
- Code is run from the first line to the the last; this is unless the computer keeps running across extremely frequent functions that change the control flow


## Java Script Functions Reading

## JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

### Additinal Notes

- ** Function Invocationn **
- In Java Script the function;s code will execute when something invokes or calls the function when:
  
  1. an event occurs
  2. when something is invoked 
  3. automatically
