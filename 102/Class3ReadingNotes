Git Intro
This topic that the reading passages are about Git/Git Hub and the terminal integrations that Git offers is very important because as developers we are going to be using Git/Git Hub throughout our careers. Addtionally, we will be using Git Hub on our respective computers (whether thats PC or Mac)

I felt like this article was so dense and there was a lot to unpack but not to much. For example, there was a lot of information about the integrations with Git Hub and the Mac terminal.

To illustrate, Git is integrated by offering terminal line comnmands that can-
Clone repositories locally to your system

commands that allow you to push all of your session changes back up to Git Hub with the Git Commit command

Is fully integrated with VS Codeand allows you to load a repository from your system straight into a VS Code environment
